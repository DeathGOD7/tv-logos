Contact: tapio.sinnertwin(at)gmail.com
I will try my best to reply within 24hr.


 
Here you will find free tv channel logos from around the world in good high-res quality and suitable for dark backgrounds.

Ipmortant note: Most of my logos only work on dark background! BIG majority of apps and tv-guides have a dark user interface.
 
  
## About the project
The logos are adjusted to work on a dark background. Some of them are not suitable for ligth backgrounds. Since the Git interface is white you might think the logo is not loading but it is, just copy the RAW link. See help-guide. I recommend getting a browser extension that changes Git to dark.

Get GitHub Dark Theme for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-dark-theme/odkdlljoangmamjilkamahebpkgpeacp">CHROME</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-dark-theme/">FIREFOX</a>


I'm close to 3000 logos!

Here's a preview of some of the logos on a dark background(not a real software):

- Donators get a channel logo request. I also take requests for custom logos or logos for a light background.

- The goal of this project is to give people better access to logos in good quality and to meet the design requirements of the designers/owners of the logos and supply the increasing demand for better quality experience.

- All the logos come in PNG format and work perfectly on dark backgrounds.

- Most of the logos will be between 512px - 1024px in width. Please contact me if you need a specific logo in specific/larger resolution.

- I also provide logos for US local networks that can be hard to find. In many cases I have to recreate them.

- For a donation I can create a hard-to-find logo or skip the queue for a specific country/network of your own choice and provide the logo's in high quality, pm for more info.

- The list is free for personal use. Please refference my work for any re-distribution. It's forbidden to sell the logos to 3rd party or use them in any illegitimate way. I do not take responsibility for what you do with the logos.

- I do not own the logos. All the logos in the project do not have copyright on them but instead they are trademarked and with Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses. PM me if you wish to remove/change a logo you own or submitt your logo.

- At some point in the future I plan to upload logos in SVG. This is not high priority right now.

- You can link directly to the URL of any logo but I do not take any responsibility if links are broken. If you are having issues with the logos url's then send me PM.

- If a channel changes its logo or rebrands, I will replace the original logo, if you are using direct link then the logo will update for you automatically.

- If you would like to be able to link the logos to a service you provide, for example a website/service/app then please contact me first.

- Did you discover a mistake? Or is something not like it should be? Then please let me know by sending me a message/email.
 
 
 
## Naming convention

Filenames are all lowercase and start with channel name and then number if applicable and country code at the end. Dashes are used to replace spaces. Call signs for local networks are also lowercase and appear before country.

Examples: *abc-7-koat-us.png | discovery-channel-us.png | syfy-br.png | fox-crime-it.png | kanal-5-se.png*

Plus channels are identified with "plus", example: *challenge-plus-uk.png*
For Australia the +2 channels are *fox-hits-plus-2-au.png*

If ampersand(&) is present in channel name then it will be replaced with "and", example: *a-and-e-us.png*

For channels that dont authenticate with a network affiliate or Owned-and-operated station then I will use the city/county/state,
Example: *7-news-miami-wsvn-us.png | 7-news-boston-whdh-us.png*

Be aware of the dash when searching for a logo in a long list of channels, include it in your search to be more precise. 
Example: *channel-4* instead of ~~channel 4~~.

A horizontal version of a logo will have hz in its name if there's a regular version also. 
Example: bbc-world-news-hz-uk.png.

This project is possible thanks to Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses, CC BY-SA and CC BY-NC-SA.
By using the logos you have to agree with the following: The logo you are about to use is the intellectual property of the copyright, trademark holder and is offered to you as a convenience for lawful use.
