# Tapiosi's Logos

After 2 weeks of hard work I'm really close to 1000 logos! The first milestone! I will add a milestone uppdates here at this page. Click watch to follow the progress.
 
Here you will find free tv channel logos from around the world in good quality and suitable for dark backgrounds.

Ipmortant note: I have over 500 logos for US Local channels from all around the US(ABC,NBC,FOX,CBS, and more) Major cities and hillbilly places. Just give me a week or two to upload all them here as I need to filter some out and redraw. Of the 500 collected, I've recreated about 40-50(that does not include when I have to flip black/white colors) so allot of work ahead. And again, most of my logos only work on dark background! There are plenty of ~~weirdos~~ awesome people doing logos for white background, but a BIG majority of TV programs and guides have dark interface. Thank you.
 
  
## About the project
I started the project on January 30th 2020, it will take a few days/weeks to upload all of the logos I have gathered throughout the years. Some logos have changed during that time and some need to be refreshed. Update log is at the bottom of the page (I will also add a link here to the main update log file).

The logos are adjusted to work on a dark background. Some of them are not suitable for ligth backgrounds.

I've spent well over 100 hours searching for the correct logos and in many cases I've needed to recreate a logo from scratch, and invert black colors to white. I've collected logos for 2 years for private use and now I feel like there's demand for a service like this one. As an educated graphic designer I will be as professional as I can and incorporate good work ethics and give the logos the care they almost never get.

Here's a preview of some of the logos on a dark background:

- The goal of this project is to give people better access to logos in good quality and to meet the design requirements of the designers/owners of the logos and supply the increasing demand for better quality experience.

- The long term goal of this projects is to have as many tv logos available as possible, from all over the world. 

- All the logos come in PNG format and work perfectly on dark backgrounds.

- In the beginning weeks the focus will be on english speaking channels.

- To save space, most of the logos will be between 250px - 1024px in width. Please contact me if you need a specific logo in specific/larger resolution.

- I also provide logos for US local networks that can be hard to find. In many cases I have to recreate them.

- For a small fee I can create a hard-to-find logo or skip the que for a specific country/network of your own choice and provide the logo's in high quality, pm for more info.

- Donators get a channel logo request. I also take requests for custom logos or logos for a light background.*

- The list is free for personal use. Please refference my work for any re-distribution. It's forbidden to sell the logos to 3rd party or use them in any illegitimate way. I do not take responsibility for what you do with the logos.

- I do not own the logos. All the logos in the project do not have copyright on them but instead they are trademarked and with Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses. PM me if you wish to remove/change a logo you own or submitt your logo.

- At some point in the future I plan to upload logos in SVG. This is not high priority right now.

- You can link directly to the URL of any logo but I do not take any responsibility if links are broken. If you are having issues with the logos url's then send me PM.

- If a channel changes its logo or rebrands, I will replace the original logo, if you are using direct link then the logo will update for you automatically. When a logo becomes defunct it will be moved to a special defunct folder and get a new url.

- If you would like to be able to link the logos to a service you provide, for example a website/service/app then please contact me first.

- Did you discover a mistake? Or is something not like it should be? Then please let me know by sending me a message/email.
 
 
 
## Naming convention

Filenames are all lowercase and start with channel name and then number if applicable and country code at the end. Dashes are used to replace spaces. Call signs for local networks are also lowercase and appear before country.

Examples: *abc-7-koat-us.png  discovery-channel-us.png  syfy-br.png  fox-crime-it.png  kanal-5-se.png*

Plus channels are identified with "plus", example: *challenge-plus-uk.png*

If ampersand(&) is present in channel name then it will be replaced by "and", example: *a-and-e-us.png*

For channels that dont authenticate with a major broadcaster then I will use the city/county/state,
Example: *7-news-miami-wsvn-us.png  7-news-boston-whdh-us.png*

Be aware of the dash when searching for a logo in a long list of channels, include it in your search to be more precise, example: *channel-4* instead of ~~channel 4~~.
There is always a dash(-) between channel name and number.

## Notes
* Custom logos for donators will be added to a special Donators folder with their name, unless the donator asks not to be shared with others. Logo sourcing/creation can take small amount of time to a few hours, all depending on how complex the logo is. If you donate and would like to send a logo request please contact me afterwards.
