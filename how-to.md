# How to get the logos image URL.

When you need to get the image URL for a logo, make sure that you have the correct URL. All logos are transparent PNG files. If you are not in dark mode in Github then you might not sometimes see the logo as its white. Trust me its there, you can right click on it.

1. The URL for the page of the logo is not the image URL. Although it looks like the image URL because of the .png ending, its not. Do not use this URL if you want to link to the image URL. This is IMPORTANT!
 
Page with a logo, this is not the logo image URL: https://github.com/Tapiosinn/tv-logos/blob/master/countries/united-states/amc-us.png
 
  
2. There are two ways of getting a working image URL. The first one by right clicking on the logo and choose 'copy image address' method, this is the quickest and easiest way. But the image URL might not have full support. Experiment with that on your system. Entering this URL in a address bar and go would update the URL to the URL in method 2.
 
Method 1, notice the end part: https://github.com/Tapiosinn/tv-logos/blob/master/countries/united-states/amc-us.png?raw=true
 
  
3. The other method and what I recommend is the right click on the logo and choose 'open image in new tab' and from the new tab copy the URL. I believe this method has best support in various websites and apps.
 
Method 2, you're safe using this one: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tapiosinn/tv-logos/master/countries/united-states/amc-us.png
 
  
4. You should have noticed that both of the URL's have 'raw' in it, but the page URL does not. Raw is important and here's what the URL's should look like. Notice how the first option method from step 2 is not a typical image URL. But both work and to bee safe I would use the one that ends with .png, the URL you get in step 3.
 
5. If a logo changes or needs update I will use the same link, so when I push out the update it should automatically update for you. If not then clear cache in your browser/restart device. Occasionally a link might go down or break, one cause would be a new name for channel or a change in naming logic. If your logo is not loading then probably the URL changed. If that happens then please go to the list and get the new URL.
