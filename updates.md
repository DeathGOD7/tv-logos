2020-02-16: Past to days added many logos. Finished updating all the HBO US logos
            To their latest look, international and many countries are sill using
            preous version of HBO. Added lots of US local logos, 80% are in low
            quality and thats not good enough. I will try to find 1-2 hours a day
            to work on those icons as most of them need to be re-drawn from scratch.
            You can now become a sponsor, I'm not sure how it works but just click
            the heart sponsor button at the top, or find my donation link. I'm
            unemployed so every little thing helps.
2020-02-14: Added all Cinemax US and Starz US logos, HBO is a WIP, HBO will take
            some time cause there are many versions of the logo, I have
            to be 100% in the HBO US version. Plus I added some other random logos.
            I'm getting close to first milestone, 1000 logos! But HBO and more is
            My main goal today. Lots of work üí™üèª Thanks to ryc3c00ker for the support!
2020-02-13: I created an International category, for all those channels that are
            not broadcasting in a specific area but instead most of the world. In
            there you'll find BBC international logos. International logos have the
            suffix -int.
