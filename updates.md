2020-02-14: Added all Cinemax US logos, and HBO is a WIP, HBO will take some time
            cause there are many versions and different between countries, I have
            to be 100% in the HBO US version. Plus I added some other random logos.
            I'm getting close to first milestone, 1000 logos! But HBO and Starz is
            My main goal today. Lots of work üí™üèª
2020-02-13: I created an International category, for all those channels that are
            not broadcasting in a specific area but instead most of the world. In
            there you'll find BBC international logos. International logos have the
            suffix -int.
