Here you'll find logos for many channels around the world.
The logos are set to work on a dark background. So some of them are not suitable for ligth backgrounds.

I've spent well over 100 hours searching for the correct logos and in many cases I had to recreate a logo from scratch,
and invert black colors to white.

Here's a preview how the logos look like on a dark background: https://imgur.com/a/v5g4gle

- The long term goal of this projects is to have as many logos available as possible, from all over the world. 

- In the beginning the focus will be on US/UK channels.

- I also provide logos for US local networks that can be hard to find. In many cases I have to recreate them.

- For a small fee I can create a hard-to-find logo or skip the que for a specific country and provide logo's in high quality, pm for more info.

- The list is free to use and I do not own the logos. Please refference me for any re-distributing. It's forbidden to sell the logos to 3rd party.

- All the logos in the project do not have copyright on them but instead they are trademarked. PM me if you wish to remove a logo you own or submitt your logo.

- The purpose of this project is to give people better acces to logos in good quality and meet the design requirements of the owners of the logos.

- All the logos come in PNG format.
